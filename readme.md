# Twitter Popularity Grapher

Inspired by [this tweet by Hank Green](https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/845659536681766912)
this is the Twitter Popularity Grapher. Its role is to graph the relative likes
and retweets of particular "topics" over time for a specific user on Twitter.

This readme is *incomplete* and will be filled out more soon! As will this repo.
